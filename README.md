# üèÜ CDMO Project ‚Äì Sports Tournament Scheduling (STS)

This repository contains the source code, experimental results, and report for the **Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization (CDMO)** project work, academic year 2024/2025.

##  Project Description

The goal of the project is to model and solve the **Sports Tournament Scheduling (STS)** problem, where `n` teams compete over `n-1` weeks. Each team must:
- Play every other team exactly once.
- Play once per week.
- Play in the same period at most twice in the tournament.

The problem was tackled using three combinatorial optimization paradigms:
- Constraint Programming (CP)
- Satisfiability/Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SAT/SMT)
- Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MIP)

An optional objective was also considered: minimizing the unbalance between home and away games for each team.

##  INFO

All models can be run through Docker to ensure reproducibility.
